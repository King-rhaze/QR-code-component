## My process
i firstly started by building the skeletal system using the HTML5 markup and started styling and editing with the css custom properties. The CSS grid helped me better understand how to effectively place objects where they should be. Then i played around with margins,paddings and colours.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- media queries and responsiveness


### What I learned
I learnt how to style media queries
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 375px) {
    .container {
      margin-top: 2rem;
      width: 320px;
    }
  }
```

### Continued development
I will further advnace my knowledge in grid and flex-box and also try to design for more screen sizes to increase my knowledge on responsiveness on all screen sizes possible.

### Useful resources
- https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp - This helped me . I really helped me with media queries and i will recommend this site for anyone who has struggles formatting media queries offhand.
